# A Simple Library UI

This project presents a basic, static user interface for a library, built entirely with **HTML** for structure and **CSS** for styling. It's designed to be a clean and straightforward example of how to lay out common UI elements for a library system, such as a book list, search bar, and navigation.

## 🚀 Features

  * **Responsive Design (Basic):** Adapts reasonably well to different screen sizes (though full responsiveness may require more advanced CSS techniques or JavaScript).
  * **Clean Layout:** Organizes library elements in an intuitive and visually appealing manner.
  * **Pure HTML & CSS:** No JavaScript or backend code involved, making it easy to understand and modify.
  * **Placeholder Content:** Includes dummy data for books and categories to illustrate the layout.

## 🎨 Customization

  * **Colors:** Modify the color values in `style.css` (e.g., `background-color`, `color`, `border-color`) to match your preferred palette.
  * **Fonts:** Change the `font-family` properties in `style.css` to use different fonts.
  * **Layout:** Adjust CSS properties like `display`, `flex`, `grid`, `margin`, and `padding` to alter the arrangement of elements.
